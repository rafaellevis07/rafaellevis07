Story 💬  
In 2013, After finishing school and college I moved to US full of dreams and projects. My goal was to learn english and work on a non-profit organization to serve the community and develop it, investing ultimately in people.  
In 2015, I became the Head of Operations of the Non-profit organization I was serving, having lots of experience with Leadership, Management, Development of People and Financial Administration.  
In 2020, Covid hit and I decided to change careers while doing a few courses on Leadership based. A friend of mine suggested programming and I felt in love with it 💻.  
In 2022, I had my first app produced by me and a few opportunities to work on the field. Now I am looking forward in more opportunities to learn and grow :boom:.
